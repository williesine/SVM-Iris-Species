##### Classmates worked with:
###### Ellie Strande --> Worked together on plotting the classifications made by the Model
###### Sam Navias --> Worked together on working through grid search (CV) of our model, and hyperparameter tuning

###### Other Notes:
###### No compile errors, but wasn't able to figure out how to properly plot the data with the decision boundaries. However, the plots included reinforce my model's efficacy (visualizes the cohesivity and separation of the features without displaying the decision bounds)
